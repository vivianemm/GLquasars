SL2S,GAL-GAL,A,SIE model,spectroscopic,spectroscopic,"This  lens system is in a cusp configuration, meaning that the source lies just within one of the four cusps of the asteroid caustic of the lens. Either a mass centroid offset from the light center or a large shear is required to match the curvature of the big arc. We found the amount of external shear to be 0.11 plus or minus 0.01.",1.27 , 0.06,0.646 , 0.001,1.847 , 0.001,257 , 26,2009-02-27,SL2S J021737-051329,2
