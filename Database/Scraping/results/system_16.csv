SL2S,GAL-GAL,A,SIE model,spectroscopic,spectroscopic,"The  source has two bright lens components, one of which is lensed into the big arc and its fainter counter-image. The second component forms a double image of smaller magnification. This lens was modeled in Paper I [Gavazzi et al. 2012] with two lens models, each with a different Einstein radii, that match the image configuration. The pixelized source  reconstruction technique adopted in Paper III [Sonnenfeld et al. 2013] to model the lens favors the solution alternative to the one chosen in Paper I.",1.41 , 0.04,0.609 , 0.001,1.880 , 0.001,289 , 16,2010-08-18,SL2S J021411-040502,2,"SL2S J021411-040503,SA23, SL2S J021411.21-040502.8"
