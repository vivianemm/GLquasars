Serendipitous,GAL-QSO,A,SIE model,spectroscopic,spectroscopic,"We  observed the quadruple gravitationally lensed image of MG J0414+0534 on  23 November 1997 with a global VLBI array at 8.4 GHz. We report wide-field imaging results of its four components at submilliarcsecond resolution, displaying complex core-like and jet-like extended structures. A simple model combining a singular isothermal ellipsoid to represent the main lens galaxy, external shear, and a singular isothermal sphere to represent an additional, nearby object accounts well for the core positions and flux densities of the VLBI images. This model predicts delays between the different lensed images of several weeks.",2.04 , 0.01,0.96 , 0.01,2.64 , 0.01,1989-01-01,MG0414+0534,4
