Danny's lensing galaxy is a large red elliptical, while the lensed source is blue, as expected for lens systems. The identified quad geometry is a typical lens geometry and may be called cusp dominated (e.g. Kochanek 2006), as it occurs when the source lies near to a cusp of the inner caustic.",0.65 , 0.03,0.34 , 0.03,0.48 , 0.03,2009-05-01,HST J073736.40+321540.3,4
